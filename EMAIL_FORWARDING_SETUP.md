## How to Check Your Current DNS Setup

Run this command to see where your domain's DNS is managed:

```bash
dig NS floridaweddingwonders.com +short
```

Or check online:
- https://dnschecker.org
- Search for: `floridaweddingwonders.com`
- Record type: `NS` (nameservers)

---

## Testing Email Forwarding

After setup (wait 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation):

1. **Send test email**
   - From any email account
   - To: hello@floridaweddingwonders.com
   - Subject: "Test forwarding"

2. **Check destination**
   - Look in bennett.boundless@gmail.com inbox
   - Also check spam folder just in case

3. **Troubleshoot if needed**
   - Verify DNS records are correct: https://dnschecker.org
   - Check SPF/DKIM records if emails go to spam
   - Wait longer (DNS can take up to 24 hours)

## Recommended Solution

**I recommend Method 3 (Cloudflare Email Routing) because:**
- ‚úÖ Free forever
- ‚úÖ No signup needed if already using Cloudflare
- ‚úÖ Automatic DNS configuration
- ‚úÖ Unlimited forwarding addresses
- ‚úÖ Built-in spam protection
- ‚úÖ Email routing rules and filters

**If not using Cloudflare, use Method 2 (ImprovMX):**

```bash
# Check your current nameservers

# Check if you have existing MX records
dig MX floridaweddingwonders.com +short
```

Share the results and I can tell you exactly which method to use!

## Next Steps

1. Choose a method (I recommend Cloudflare or ImprovMX)
2. Add the DNS records
3. Wait 5-30 minutes for propagation
4. Test by sending an email to hello@floridaweddingwonders.com
5. Confirm it arrives at bennett.boundless@gmail.com

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **If you already have MX records** (for sending emails via Resend):
- You'll need to decide: forwarding OR sending, not both from the same service
- Best practice: Use Resend for *sending* (noreply@) and ImprovMX/Cloudflare for *receiving* (hello@)
- Keep separate MX records for each subdomain if needed

üìß **For a complete email solution**:
- **Sending** (automated emails): Use Resend with `noreply@floridaweddingwonders.com`
- **Receiving** (customer emails): Use ImprovMX/Cloudflare with `hello@floridaweddingwonders.com`
- This way you have both sending and receiving working properly!
