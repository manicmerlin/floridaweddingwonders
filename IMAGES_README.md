# Venue Image Management System

This project now includes a comprehensive image scraping and management system for all wedding venues.

## üì∏ Image System Overview

### Local Image Storage
- **Location**: `/public/images/venues/`
- **Format**: High-quality JPEG images (1200x800px)
- **Naming**: `venue-{id}-{safe-name}-{number}.jpg`
- **Total Images**: 229 images across 81 venues

### Image Sources
- **Primary**: Local scraped images from wedding venue websites
- **Google Images**: High-quality venue photos from Google Maps/Business listings
- **Fallback**: Removed Unsplash fallbacks (venues without images show "Photos coming soon")
- **Permission**: All images scraped with appropriate permissions

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts & Tools

### 1. Image Scraping (`scripts/scrapeVenueImages.js`)
```bash
node scripts/scrapeVenueImages.js
```
- Downloads high-quality venue images
- Creates safe filenames from venue names
- Handles errors gracefully with retry logic
- Downloads 3-4 images per venue

### 2. Venue Data Update (`scripts/updateVenuesWithImages.js`)
```bash
node scripts/updateVenuesWithImages.js
```
- Updates `venues.json` with local image paths
- Maps downloaded images to venue data
- Creates image manifest for tracking

### 3. Image Verification (`scripts/verifyImages.js`)
```bash
node scripts/verifyImages.js
```
- Verifies all venue images are accessible
- Reports success rates and missing images
- Lists unused image files

## üìä Current Status

- **Total Venues**: 124
- **Venues with Images**: 81 (65.3%)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
Each venue in `venues.json` now includes:
```json
{
  "name": "Venue Name",
  "images": [
    {
      "id": "img1-1",
      "url": "/images/venues/venue-1-venue-name-1.jpg",
      "alt": "Venue Name main venue photo",
      "isPrimary": true
    }
  ],
  "lastImageUpdate": "2025-09-10T..."
}
```

### Next.js Integration
