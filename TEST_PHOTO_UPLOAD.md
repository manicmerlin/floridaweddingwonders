# Testing Photo Upload Fix

## What Was Fixed

The photo upload system now properly saves and displays uploaded photos across all pages.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed PhotoUpload Component Props** (`VenueManagement.tsx`)
   - Changed `existingPhotos` → `existingMedia`
   - Changed `onPhotosUpdate` → `onMediaUpdate`
   - Changed `maxPhotos` → `maxFiles`
   - Added `type: 'image'` property to all photo objects

2. **Updated Photo Storage** (`photoStorage.ts`)
   - Added `type: 'image'` to all storage functions
   - Ensured type-safe photo handling

3. **Updated Venue Pages to Load Stored Photos**
   - `/venues/[id]/page.tsx` - Individual venue detail page
   - `/venues/page.tsx` - All venues listing page
   - Both now check localStorage for uploaded photos

## How to Test

### Step 1: Navigate to Bonnet House
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Wedding Venues"
3. Search for or scroll to "Bonnet House Museum & Gardens"
4. Click on the venue

### Step 2: Access Management Dashboard
1. On the Bonnet House page, you need to be logged in as admin or venue owner
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/venues/[VENUE_ID]/manage
   - Replace [VENUE_ID] with the actual ID (check the URL or data)
   - OR use Super Admin login to access any venue

### Step 3: Upload Photos
1. Click on the "Photos" tab
2. Click "Select Files" or drag and drop images
3. You should see the images preview immediately
4. Click "Upload Files" to save them
5. Click "Save Changes"

### Step 4: Verify Display
1. Navigate back to the venue detail page: `/venues/[id]`
2. **Refresh the page** to see the uploaded photos
3. The photos should now appear in the gallery
4. Go back to `/venues` listing page and refresh
5. The new primary photo should appear on the venue card

## Important Notes

- **localStorage**: Photos are stored in browser localStorage for now
- **Refresh Required**: After uploading, you need to refresh the venue pages to see changes
- **Browser-Specific**: Uploads are stored per browser (clearing cache will remove uploads)
- **Primary Photo**: The first photo uploaded becomes the primary thumbnail

## Troubleshooting

### Photos Not Showing After Upload
1. Make sure you clicked "Upload Files" button
2. Make sure you clicked "Save Changes"
3. Refresh the venue detail page (hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Check that localStorage has the data:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('venue-photos')));
   ```

### Upload Button Not Working
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Make sure you're logged in as venue owner or admin
3. Verify file size is under 10MB for images
4. Verify file type is JPG, PNG, or WebP

### Changes Not Persisting
- Remember: localStorage is browser-specific
- Clearing browser data will remove uploads
- In production, this will use a real database

## Next Steps

For production deployment, the photo storage will need to be updated to:
1. Upload to cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
2. Save photo URLs to Supabase database
3. Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. Add image optimization and CDN delivery
