# Email Forwarding with Resend - Florida Wedding Wonders
## Forward: hello@floridaweddingwonders.com → bennett.boundless@gmail.com

---

## ✅ Using Your Existing Resend Account

Since you already have a Resend account and API key, you can use Resend's email forwarding feature!

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Login to Resend Dashboard (1 minute)

1. Go to https://resend.com/login
2. Login with your Resend credentials
3. You should see your dashboard

### Step 2: Check if Domain is Added (1 minute)

1. Click **"Domains"** in the left sidebar
2. Check if `floridaweddingwonders.com` is listed
3. If YES → Go to Step 3
4. If NO → Click **"Add Domain"** and enter `floridaweddingwonders.com`

### Step 3: Add MX Records for Receiving Emails (5 minutes)

Resend requires MX records to receive emails. Add these to Vercel DNS:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Navigate to Domains → floridaweddingwonders.com → DNS

2. **Add Resend MX Records**
   
   **Record 1:**
   - **Type**: MX
   - **Name**: @ (or leave blank)
   - **Value**: `mx1.resend.com`
   - **Priority**: 10

   **Record 2:**
   - **Type**: MX  
   - **Name**: @ (or leave blank)
   - **Value**: `mx2.resend.com`
   - **Priority**: 20

### Step 4: Set Up Email Forwarding in Resend (2 minutes)

1. In Resend dashboard, click on your domain `floridaweddingwonders.com`
2. Look for **"Email Forwarding"** or **"Inbound"** section
3. Click **"Add Forward"** or **"Create Rule"**
4. Configure:
   - **From**: `hello@floridaweddingwonders.com`
   - **Forward to**: `bennett.boundless@gmail.com`
5. Click **"Save"** or **"Create"**

### Alternative: Use Resend API for Forwarding

If Resend UI doesn't have forwarding yet, you can use their Inbound Webhooks:

1. Go to **Domains** → `floridaweddingwonders.com`
2. Click **"Inbound"** or **"Webhooks"**
3. Add webhook endpoint (we can create one for auto-forwarding)

## 🎯 What You'll Have After Setup

✅ **Email Forwarding**: hello@floridaweddingwonders.com → bennett.boundless@gmail.com  
✅ **Same Platform**: All email sending AND receiving in one dashboard  
✅ **Professional**: Domain already verified for sending  
✅ **Integrated**: No need for third-party services  

---

## 🚀 Quick Alternative: Resend Inbound Webhook

If Resend doesn't have direct forwarding UI, we can set up automatic forwarding using their webhook:

### Create Forwarding Endpoint

We'll add an API endpoint that receives emails and forwards them:

```bash
# I can create this endpoint for you
# It will:
# 1. Receive email at hello@floridaweddingwonders.com
# 2. Automatically forward to bennett.boundless@gmail.com
# 3. Use your existing Resend API key
```

Would you like me to:
1. **Option A**: Guide you through Resend's UI for forwarding (if available)
2. **Option B**: Create an auto-forwarding webhook endpoint for you
