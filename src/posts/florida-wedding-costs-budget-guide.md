## Top 10 Money-Saving Strategies

### 1. **Choose Off-Peak Season (May-October)**
**Savings: 30-40% on venues**

Florida summers are hot and humid, but venues offer significant discounts. Budget air conditioning and have a rain backup plan.

### 2. **Friday or Sunday Wedding**
**Savings: 20-30% on venues**

Saturday premium pricing adds $1,000-$3,000. Friday evening or Sunday brunch weddings cost less and may have better vendor availability.

### 3. **Reduce Guest Count**
**Savings: $50-$150 per guest eliminated**

Every guest impacts catering, rentals, favors, and invitations. Trimming 20 guests saves $1,000-$3,000.

### 4. **All-Inclusive Package**
**Savings: 15-25% vs. Ã  la carte**

Venues offering packages (food, bar, coordinator, linens) often cost less than piecing together separately.

### 5. **Limit Bar Options**
**Savings: $10-$30 per person**

Beer, wine, and signature cocktail only (vs. full open bar) saves thousands. Or do a 2-hour open bar, then switch to cash.

### 6. **In-Season, Local Ingredients**
**Savings: 15-25% on catering**

Florida seafood in summer, citrus in winter. Local menus cost less than imported ingredients.

### 7. **Prioritize Photographer Over Videographer**
**Savings: $2,000-$4,000**

If choosing between the two, photos are more versatile and affordable. You can always hire a videographer for less later.

### 8. **DIY What You Can (Safely)**
**Savings: $500-$2,000**

Safe DIY projects: favors, welcome signs, programs, centerpieces. Hire pros for: hair, makeup, flowers (if complex), cake.

### 9. **Digital Invitations & RSVPs**
**Savings: $300-$700**

Sites like Paperless Post, Greenvelope, and Evite offer beautiful designs. Save trees and money.

### 10. **Borrow & Reuse DÃ©cor**
**Savings: $500-$1,500**

Ask recently married friends, check Buy Nothing groups, or work with another wedding the same weekend to share rentals.

## Where to Splurge

Not everything should be cut to save money. Invest in these areas for best ROI:

### 1. **Photography**
You'll treasure these memories forever. Great photos are priceless.

### 2. **Food Quality**
Guests remember good (or bad) food more than most dÃ©cor. Don't skimp here.

### 3. **Comfortable Venue**
Climate-controlled space in Florida summer is worth premium pricing.

### 4. **Professional Coordination**
Day-of coordinator ($800-$1,500) prevents disasters and lets you enjoy your day.

### 5. **Good Music**
Whether DJ or band, quality entertainment keeps guests happy and dancing.

## Hidden Costs to Avoid

### 1. **Overtime Charges**
Venue contracts end at specific times. Extra hours cost $100-$300/hourâ€”can add up fast.

### 2. **"Vendor Meal" Charges**
$15-$30 per vendor for dinner adds up with 10+ vendors = $150-$300.

### 3. **Setup/Breakdown Fees**
Some venues charge $200-$500 for setup/teardown. Ask upfront.

### 4. **Service Charges vs. Gratuity**
"Service charge" isn't a tipâ€”staff don't receive it. Budget additional 15-20% gratuity.

### 5. **Permits & Insurance**
Beach permits, alcohol permits, liability insurance can add $300-$800.
